# Rejection Email Counter

This is a project I am building in Python to check my emails in a specific email account and output the total amount of emails I have recieved that has to do with me not being selected to move forward in an interview process for a software engineering role since being laid off. :-)

This project is partially a joke project, but also a nice way to help me dive deeper into Python's versatility and also teach me how to check emails and other things with a Python script!
